Make your forms look and feel like an app by adding Google's Material Design to Contact Form 7.

== Description ==

Make your forms look and feel like an app by adding Google's Material Design to Contact Form 7.

= Contact Form 7 style =
This plugin provides a bunch of shortcodes that are made to wrap your Contact Form 7 shortcodes and apply a material design theme to them.

= Contact Form 7 + Material Design in action =
Take 30 seconds and see how your contact forms could look. Watch the video below and/or play with the [live demos](http://cf7materialdesign.com).

= Contact Form 7 can be more interactive =
Make your form fields react to user input more intuitively. Field labels start as placeholders and float up when you focus the field. Checkboxes and radios animate when you click them. Submit buttons include the Material Design 'ripple' effect. And more!

= Currently supported: =
* Light or dark theme
* Text input (includes text, email, url, tel, number, date)
* Textarea with optional auto-resizing
* Select/drop-down menu
* Checkboxes
* Radios
* Acceptance
* File upload field
* Submit button (including loading spinner)
* Quiz
* ReCaptcha
* Other (validation/success messages etc)

= Pro version: =
* Customize colours and fonts
* Arrange fields into columns
* Turn radios and checkboxes into [switches](https://material.io/guidelines/components/selection-controls.html#selection-controls-switch)
* Group fields into sections with [cards](https://material.io/guidelines/components/cards.html)
* Direct email support

You can upgrade to pro at any time without leaving WordPress.

= Responsive Contact Form =
Material Design for Contact Form 7 is fully responsive. It adapts to your screen size and works on any device.

= Contact Form Style =
Material Design for Contact Form 7 applies the default Material Design colours and fonts to your form by default, but you can use the WordPress customizer to change the fonts and colours to your liking if you're on the Pro version.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is Material Design? =
Material Design is a set of guidelines, written by Google, that outline how your website or app should look and behave. Most Google apps use Material Design, including Android itself.

= Do I need a Material Design theme as well? =
Not at all! The beauty of Material Design is that you can take as much or as little of it as you like. It's perfectly fine to just have your forms styled with Material Design and not the rest of your site.

= How do I use this plugin? =
All documentation can be found by clicking 'Help' (top right of the screen) and then 'Material Design' from the CF7 form editor screen.

= It doesn't look right for me! =
Some themes have styles that override the material design styles. If this happens to you, post a link to your form page in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/material-design-for-contact-form-7/) and I'll help you fix it.
